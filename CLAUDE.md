# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status
This is a new, empty git repository with no source code files, configuration files, or commits yet. The project structure and architecture will be determined as development begins.

## Common Development Tasks
As this is a new project, common development tasks will need to be established:

### Initial Setup
1. Determine the programming language and framework for the project
2. Initialize the project structure based on the chosen technology stack
3. Set up version control and development workflow
4. Configure development environment (IDE, linters, formatters, etc.)

### Building and Running
- The build and run commands will depend on the chosen technology stack
- Common options include: npm run dev, cargo run, python -m, go run, etc.
- Set up appropriate scripts in package.json, Makefile, or similar build configuration

### Testing
- Set up testing framework appropriate for the chosen language
- Configure test scripts and test directories
- Establish testing conventions and coverage requirements

### Code Quality
- Configure linting tools (ESLint, Rustfmt, Black, etc.)
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- Establish code formatting standards

## Development Workflow
1. Create initial project structure and configuration files
2. Set up development environment and dependencies
3. Implement features following established patterns
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Run linting and formatting checks
6. Commit changes with descriptive messages
7. Push to remote repository when ready

## Architecture Guidance
Since this is a new project, architecture decisions should be made based on:
- Project requirements and scope
- Team expertise and preferences
- Performance and scalability needs
- Maintainability and future growth

Common architectural patterns to consider:
- Monolithic vs microservices
- Frontend framework choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Backend language and framework (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Database selection (SQL vs NoSQL)
- API design patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)

## Important Notes
- This repository is currently empty - all project files will need to be created
- Development environment setup will be required based on the chosen technology stack
- Project-specific guidelines should be added as the project evolves
- Regular updates to this file should reflect the current project state and conventions
